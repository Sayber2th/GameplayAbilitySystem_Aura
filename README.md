//* WORK IN PROGRESS BUILD *//
This project best demonstrates my current skill level.

NOTE - 
1) This project is being made by taking an advanced course on Udemy on the vast and complex Gameplay Ability System within Unreal Engine.
2) This project is being created in Unreal Engine using a combination of C++ and Unreal Engine's visual scripting language - Blueprint. All complex functionality is done in C++, while some minor functionality 
   is implemented within Blueprint.
3) All C++ code is available in this repository.
4) This project is being built with multiplayer support in mind.


//* Controls *//

Movement - left click tap to auto move character to location, hold to move the character in the direction of the mouse cursor
Shoot fireball - while aiming at and highlighting an enemy, left click. To shoot manually hold left shift and left click to shoot a fireball without the need to highlight an enemy.


//* Objective *//

The goal of this project is to improve my coding skills by writing clean code in an easy-to-understand manner.


//* Challenges *//

The concept of multiplayer coding felt tough to understand and grasp. The concept of setting up expandable code for the multiplayer replication of attributes and tags was a challenge for this project.


//* Lessons learnt *//

This project/course has taught me many concepts of game development/programming. Notable ones are as follows:-
1) Debugging code.
2) Writing modular, easy-to-refactor code that takes into account the possibility of future additions/changes.
3) Writing clean and easy-to-read code.
4) Solving technical issues that may arise while working with coding software.
5) Multiplayer coding basics.
6) Good workflow for writing code.
