//* WORK IN PROGRESS BUILD *//
This project best demonstrates my current skill level.

NOTE - 
1) This project is being made by taking an advanced course on Udemy on the vast and complex Gameplay Ability System within Unreal Engine.
2) This project is being created in Unreal Engine using a combination of C++ and Unreal Engine's visual scripting language - Blueprint. All complex functionality is done in C++, while some minor functionality 
   is implemented within Blueprint.
3) All C++ code is available in this repository.
4) This project is being built with multiplayer support in mind.


//* Controls *//

Movement - Tap left click to auto-move the character to location, hold left click to manually move the character in the direction of the mouse cursor
Shoot fireball - While aiming at and highlighting an enemy, left click to shoot a fireball targeted at the highlighted enemy. To shoot manually without the need for a highlighted enemy, hold left shift and left click.


//* Objective *//

The primary objective of this project is to learn about the Gameplay Ability System of Unreal Engine in the context of a multiplayer game. A secondary goal of this project was to improve my overall coding skills and specifically write clean code that is easy to expand upon and easy to understand.


//* Challenges *//

Understanding and setting up expandable code for the multiplayer replication of attributes and tags in Unreal Engine was a big challenge for this project. This in tandem with learning the Gameplay Ability System turned out to be the most challenging project for me so far.


//* Lessons learnt *//

This project/course has taught me many new concepts of game development and improved my existing skills. They are as follows:-
1) Learning to debug code and to do so efficiently by reading the call stack recognising the important call stack path.
2) Writing modular, easy-to-refactor code that takes into account the possibility of future additions/changes.
3) Improving my skill of writing clean and easy-to-read code.
4) Getting better at solving technical issues that may arise while working with coding software.
5) Learning what it takes to set up a game for multiplayer.
6) Improving my workflow for writing code.
